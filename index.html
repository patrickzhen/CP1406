    <h1>Goals:</h1>
    <p>The main goal for this website is to provide an online interface where potential customers can interact with the website to gain knowledge but most importantly, sign up. The Goal here is to gain at least a 50% player base on what Slammers Beach Volleyball already has in their player count. Currently, they have around 100 players per week, so we hope to increase this by at least 50 or so players. Getting their presence out on the web should help this target be viable and with a properly formed site which I am going to complete the goal should be passable with ease.</p>
    <h1>Success Evaluation:</h1>
    <p>To evaluate my success in this scenario would be easy. The client wishes to have a 50% increase in their player base. A physical number that can be monitored is always an easy measurement of success. Should we surpass the goals set by our employer, the project will be successful.</p>
    <h1>Target Audience:</h1>
    <p>When building the Slammers Beach Volleyball website, I will need to keep in mind that they are trying to encourage a younger demographic then what they have currently. We will use vibrant colors and vigorous Sign Up targeting to call our viewers into signing up. We may post some deals on the homepage and make the current leaderboards accessible to all to increase sportsmanship. All these things together will interest new players.</p>
